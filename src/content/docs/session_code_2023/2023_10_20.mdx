During the Friday (Oct 20th) class, boolean and conditional logic was introduced. 
You will be seeing these types of control structures for the rest of your programming journey,
and it's important that you start to understand them early. 

Fear not! These concepts can be broken down to two outcomes: <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.

## PASS Session example

During the PASS Session we were tasked with writing a statement that outputs the outcome 
of a set of boolean conditions as a string. 

The conditions were the following:
- if num1 is > num2
- if num2 is > num1
- if num1 is == num2

If you attended the session, try to recreate what we did! I have the solution below,
but one of the most effective ways to learn is to recall the information on your own. 
Try not to rely on the answers immediately. 

First, let's start by understanding the problem. We want to output a specific 
answer for each of the conditions listed above. For example, if the condition 
is "if num1 is > num2" then we want to change our output to something that reflects 
that, such as "num1 is GREATER THAN num2". The same can be said for the other two
conditions. Try those yourself! 

Next, we need to create variables to store values. Ideally, we name them as closely
to our problem as possible, therefore <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> are 
good choices for our problem. You can choose to store any numbers you think are 
appropriate in these variables. 

Lastly, we must structure our <code>if</code> statements. Remember, when using an <code>if</code>
statement we must follow the structure below:

```python
# IF comes first
if (condition goes here):
    code block goes here
# ELSE IF can be in the middle or at the end
elif (condition goes here):
    code block goes here
# ELSE can only be at the end
else:
    code block goes here
```

The <code>if</code> must come first, then as many <code>elif</code> statements (else if)
as you need for your code, and you may use one <code>else</code> statement but it must
come at the end, and it will not have a condition. Typically, the <code>else</code> is
used as a catch-all for the remaining conditions that do not necessarily need to be 
specified. Consider the example below:

```python
# Example where an ELSE statement is useful
num = 5
if num == 5:
    print("num is 5")
else:
    print("num is NOT 5")
```

With that information, I think you're ready to code out the solution! So give it a try,
and if you get stuck there is a solution below. BUT, try to give it a go on your own
before depending on it.

<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Reveal Code Solution - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```python
# Need 2 integer variables
# Change these numbers based on the outcome you want
num1 = 3 
num2 = 3

# Need to store our output/answer
answer = ""

# We need IF STATEMENTS
if num1 > num2:
    answer = "num1 is GREATER THAN num2"
elif num2 > num1:
    answer = "num2 is GREATER THAN num1"
else:
    answer = "num1 is EQUAL TO num2"

# Output our answer
print(answer)
```
</details>

## CodingBat - cigar_party

We also worked on a CodingBat problem during the session. My solution is below, so for an added challenge,
try to go through the code and comment each line and why each line is the way it is. Can you make my code
shorter? Did you know that it's possible to get this down to 4 or 5 lines of code?


Here is my modified solution for the [coding bat problem]('https://codingbat.com/prob/p195669') from the PASS Session:

```python
def cigar_party( cigars, is_weekend ):
    # Comment here
    answer = False
    # Comment here
    if is_weekend == True and cigars >= 40:
        answer = True
    # Comment here
    elif is_weekend == False:
        # Comment here
        if ( cigars >= 40 and cigars <= 60 ):
            answer = True
        # Comment here
        elif ( cigars < 40 or cigars > 60 ):
            answer = False
    # Comment here
    return answer
```
