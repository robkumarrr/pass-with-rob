##### Hi Everyone! I'll be hosting PASS Sessions on:
<ul>
	<li><h4>Tuesdays from 10 AM to 11 AM (ROOM TBD)</h4></li>
	<li><h4>Wednesdays from 10 AM to 11 AM (ONLINE - Waiting for link)</h4></li>
	<li><h4>Fridays from 12 PM to 1 PM (ROOM TBD)</h4></li>
</ul>

These sessions give us the opportunity to have collaborative study sessions. We can work together on 
problems that you're facing in your class. Perhaps there's a <code>for loop</code> that you're stuck on,
or maybe a <code>flow chart</code> is getting complicated. Whatever it may be, I'm here to help!

##### So, **how do you use this website?**

It's quite simple! On the left-hand side of the page, you should see a sidebar that contains content from
all of the past PASS Sessions for this term. You will also see a section for **Information** (that's where you
are right now), and **Study Tools**. If you're viewing this on mobile you may need to click on the menu icon in 
the top right-hand corner of your screen.

When you're in a specific section on this website, you will also notice that each section has their own sub-navigation
found on the right-hand side of the page. Each of those menus starts with the **Overview** and then it follows all
of the headings found in the document. 

I will ***try my best*** to update this site as soon after a PASS Session as possible, but I am also quite busy so 
there may be a few days where it takes me a little longer. I want to make sure that everything I upload is high
quality and something that can be used for your success this term.

:::caution[Note]
You may notice that certain pages go further in depth than others, and that is simply because the content is a reflection
of the session itself. So you may find repetitions of definitions throughout, or you may find some sections lack perfect
clarity. Like I mentioned above, the best way to take advantage of PASS is to attend a session!
