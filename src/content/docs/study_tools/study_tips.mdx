### The Basics 

Typically, studying all stems from the same few rules. You need to focus on the specific content that
you are struggling with, which can be difficult, and then you need to repeatedly work on that material,
including the material you are *already good at*.
You may be wondering why you would want to even address things you are already good 
at, but it's important to not let yourself forget even the easiest material while you are learning harder
concepts. Think of learning as a pyramid, if we can imagine that the bottom of the pyramid is our foundational
knowledge, then we can continue to build upon those foundations.

### Active Recall

After spending years in academia, I must say that I have found the most success in a studying technique
known as *Active Recall*. I have have read and re-read course material, academic papers, documentation
and more, to only learn minor details from those sources. The main issue was that I spent time just
consuming material, and I never actually tested myself on the material. 

In essence, this studing technique requires learners to retrieve information
that they have already learned. The idea of *Active Recall* is that you are actively engaging with 
the material and you are forcing yourself to remember specific details. This is important because 
it provides you with feedback immediately! When you're just reading and re-reading material, you are 
not challenging yourself (perhaps just to stay awake through some dry material haha). 

You can read more about active recall [here](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2022/02/21/active-recall-the-most-effective-highyield-learning-technique).

:::caution[Studying for Programming]
It may seem obvious for how we can apply Active Recall for content like math, english, history, science 
and other subjects alike, but programing feels a bit different. Programming requires a ton of repetition 
and so the *testing* may come in a different form. Read down below for how you can implement active recall
for programming courses.
