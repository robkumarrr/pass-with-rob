#### Hello! I'm Rob. 

Like yourself, I am also a student at Mohawk College. I'm currently in my third semester
and I love programming. I didn't start here though. I suppose that since you're on this page, 
you're probably wondering what brought me into this field. Well, I have a Bachelors of Kinesiology
and Masters of Science from Brock University. I originally thought I wanted to be a chiropractor,
then I thought I wanted to be a professor at a university in the field of ergonomics and biomechanics. 
I must give credit to my Masters supervisor who first introduced me to programming in MATLAB (a very powerful,
1-indexed engineering languge). Along the way, I spent several years as a teaching assistant for a 
biomechanics course at Brock, and I've lectured to hundreds of students, where I found a passion for
education and teaching. I've helped tons of students succeed in their academics, and I'm happy that 
I am able to facilitate study sessions for you this semester.

During the pandemic, I left the academic world and quit my pursuit of research. My love for tech
and computers was rekindled and I decided to apply to Mohawk for Software Development. I started in 
the programming in the Fall of 2022, and I've been enjoying every moment of it (even CSS grids haha).
I was a PASS Leader during the Winter 2023 semester for COMP 10001 and I'm happy to have the 
opportunity again this term. 

That's enough about academics. In my free time, I'm probably playing Destiny 2, listening to music (metal and country),
going to concerts, or hanging out with my incredible partner, Bridget, and our dog, Hazel. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope this website brings value to your education this term.
