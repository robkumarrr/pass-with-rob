### Random Number Generation and Objects

Hello! I hope you folks found this week of content useful. During this session on Zoom we learned
how to use the [<code>Random</code> class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html), 
which was useful in generating random (or, pseudorandom) values!

In the example below, you'll see the Main class, and below that you will see the RandomNumberGenerator
class. Please have a good luck at both, and try your best to read through what's going on! That's 
always the first step. Reading code will become an incredible asset when you progress through the 
semesters in this program. 

**Unfortunately, I have had limited time so I will briefly explain the implementation below and leave 
it up to you to ask questions (robert.kumar@mohawkcollege.ca) if any should arise . Also, keep in mind that I will not be uploading 
everything to the website.**

In essence, the RandomNumberGenerator class gives us the ability to create objects that have a method 
called "roll". The "roll" method let's us return a random value within a given range. Read more 
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#nextInt-int-). The Main class
is where we created an array of 100,000 of those RandomNumberGenerator objects. Then, we created individual
RandomNumberGenerator objects for every position in that array.

:::tip[Documentation]
I know I've mentioned this before, but make sure you get comfortable with reading documentation. 
There are a ton of incredible resources out there that can answer quick questions, but when you read
documentation, you start to build up resilience. There will be times that you will see error codes 
that don't come up too often. So, Google might have limited solutions! Sometimes the best way to solve
these issues is to follow the breadcrumbs through the documentation.

#### Main.java:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        RandomNumberGenerator[] rngArray = new RandomNumberGenerator[100_000];
        int maxValue = 11;
        int[] valueCounter = new int[maxValue - 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < rngArray.length; i++) {
            rngArray[i] = new RandomNumberGenerator(maxValue);
        }

        int valueWeRolled;
        for (RandomNumberGenerator rngObject : rngArray) {
            valueWeRolled = rngObject.roll();
            valueCounter[valueWeRolled - 1]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < valueCounter.length; i++)
            System.out.printf("Value of %d occurred %d times\n", i + 1, valueCounter[i]);
    }
}
```

#### RandomNumberGenerator.java:
```java
import java.util.Random;

public class RandomNumberGenerator {

    Random rand = new Random();
    int objectMax;

    public RandomNumberGenerator(int max) {
        objectMax = max;
    }

    public int roll() {
        int randomValue = 0;
        randomValue = rand.nextInt(1, 6);
        return randomValue;
    }
}

```

#### Thanks for checking out the session notes! See you next time.
