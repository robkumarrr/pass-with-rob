### The Task 
During this session we worked on a simple function that has 3 integer parameters and returns the
sum of those values. We want to access this function after first receiving 3 integer inputs from 
the user, then we will pass those variables to the function as arguments. To finish, we will print
the function output.

### Anatomy of a Function

So, to define a function we must start with the key word of <code>def</code> which is then followed
by the <code>function_name</code> (notice how there are no spaces in the function name) and lastly,
the parameters the function may have. The parameters are held in parentheses immediately after 
naming the function. Do NOT forget the colon (<code>:</code>) after the parameter parentheses.

```python
def function_name(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    # function code block goes here
```

### Inputs 

Getting an input from a user is fairly straightforward, but this will not save the input anywhere.

```python
input("Enter a number: ")
```

Saving that input to a variable can be accomplished like so:

```python
user_input = input("Enter a number: ") 
```

Notice how I assign the <code>user_input</code> variable the input from the <code>input</code> function.  

### Function to Add 3 Numbers

Before we get ahead of ourselves and create a dialogue with the user, let's start by defining our function.

```python
def addThreeNumbers(num1, num2, num3):
    return num1 + num2 + num3
```
</details>

How did yours look? If it wasn't the same, that's OKAY! But, test your function to see if it returns the correct
values. An alternate version may have a variable called <code>added_values</code> which gets <code>num1, num2, and num3</code>
added to it, then you may just <code>return</code> that variable.


### Implementing User Input with the Function

Let's create a nice-looking dialogue for the user so they can interact with the program. You can check out my full solution
below, but make sure you give this an honest attempt before looking! Use all of your resources (course notes, W3Schools etc.).

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Reveal Code Solution - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```python
# Functions
def addThreeNumbers( num1, num2, num3 ):
    return num1 + num2 + num3

# Main Method
print("The following code will prompt you to enter 3 values")

user_input_1 = input( "Enter first number: " ) # get first number
user_input_2 = input( "Enter second number: " ) # get second number
user_input_3 = input( "Enter third number: " ) # get third number

print(addThreeNumbers(user_input_1, user_input_2, user_input_3))
```
</details>

:::tip[Get Descriptive, Comment Your Code and Make it Look Good!]
Name your variables meaningfully! Look at my solution above, you can clearly see what each variable is being used for. 
Don't be afraid to give your variables longer names. Clarity for the user or other programmers is incredibly valuable. I
also space things out nicely so you can see everything clearly (spaces between <code>=</code> or function calls, or between
parentheses).

As a challenge, revisit some of your first programs 1 year from now, and see if you can still understand what the code
does. 
:::

Alright, if you're reading this, then chances are you've tried your own code, and it works! OR... you copied and pasted what I had 
in the code block... right? But, you ran into an issue. Your <code>print</code> statement isn't returning the sum of the 3 
values the way you expected it to happen. Instead, it appears to be putting the 3 values together, but not summing them. 

How frustrating! But we did everything *perfectly* right? Maybe not...

```python
# Functions
def addThreeNumbers(num1, num2, num3):
    return num1 + num2 + num3

# Main Method
print("The following code will prompt you to enter 3 values")

user_input_1 = int( input( "Enter first number: " )) # get first number
user_input_2 = int( input( "Enter second number: " )) # get second number
user_input_3 = int( input("Enter third number: " )) # get third number

print(addThreeNumbers(user_input_1, user_input_2, user_input_3))
```
</details>

"Wait... Rob, isn't that the same as above?"

Nope! Take a *close* look at each of the <code>user input</code> variables. Notice anything? 

Perhaps you picked up on the <code>int</code> casting that I wrapped around each of the <code>input</code>
functions. That allowed us to convert the string inputs into integers, which can then be added properly
in the function.
