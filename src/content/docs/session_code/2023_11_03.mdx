## Prime Numbers
 
:::caution[Prime Code]
***The complete prime code is at the bottom of this page.***

In preparation for your test, your instructor has requested that you attempt to
solve the problem involving prime numbers. The task is to loop through a set of 
numbers and identify the primes that are in that given set. There are a handful
of ways to accomplish this.

So, what is a prime number? It's a number that is **only** divisible by itself 
and the number 1. Can you think of any examples of prime numbers that stick out 
immediately?

```python
# Prime Numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 etc. 

# Not Prime Numbers:
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 etc.

```

## Why is this problem important?

Understanding how to check if a number is prime is important in programming
fundamentals because it showcases your ability to implement a variety of operations
and control structures. This could include <code>for loops, while loops, modulus, 
if statements, and or functions</code>.

## Let's code!

### Basic Structuring 

There's a couple of strategies that we can use to approach this problem. 
First, we should consider how we are "getting" the numbers that we want to evaluate.
Are we using a list? Are we importing a file? Are we just looping through a range
of set values? Lots of choice! For the purpose of this example, we are going to 
just loop through a range of values that we hard code into our program. 

Here's a basic loop that prints every value from 0 to 100. 

```python
# Acceptable arguments for range():
# range(stop)
# range(start, stop[, step])

for i in range(0, 101):
    print(i)
```

Let's make this <code>for loop</code> more descriptive! 

```python
# changed name of variable i
for number_to_test in range(0, 101):
    print(number_to_test)
```

Notice that I only changed the name of <code>i</code> so that it is more accurately
representing the problem. 

Earlier, we said that prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7.. etc. This means that we start
at 2 and go up from there. 0 and 1 are **not** prime.

```python
# modified range to reflect valid numbers
for number_to_test in range(2, 101):
    print(number_to_test)
```

So how do we check each number in the range if it's prime? What type of control structure
will allow us to do this? Let's revisit the example of prime numbers from above:

```python
# Prime Numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 etc. 

# Not Prime Numbers:
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 etc.

# How to think about this:
4 / 1 = 4
4 / 2 = 2 # NOT PRIME
4 / 3 = 1.33
4 / 4 = 1 

```

Consider the following: 
1. number_to_test = 2:
    - 2 / 1 = 2
    - 2 / 2 = 1
    - **2 is prime!** 
2. number_to_test = 3:
    - 3 / 1 = 3
    - 3 / 2 = 1.5 -> NOT EVENLY DIVISIBLE BY DIVISOR
    - 3 / 3 = 1
    - **3 IS PRIME**
3. number_to_test = 4:
    - 4 / 1 = 4
    - 4 / 2 = 2 -> **EVENLY DIVISIBLE BY DIVISOR... So... NOT PRIME!**
    - No need to even check if 4 / 3 or 4 / 4

How do we code this? Let's think for a moment. The numbered items in that list 
all correspond to some of the values of <code>number_to_test (2, 3 and 4)</code> .
Then, the bullets below each value correspond to another set of values, each starting
from <code>1</code>. So, we check if each value in <code>number_to_test</code> is 
divisible by a divisor up to <code>number_to_test</code>, and once we get to a 
divisor that breaks our "prime" rule, we want to stop checking anything past that divisor.
For example, once we found that 4 / 2 = 2, we know it's not prime - so why bother
checking if 4 / 3 is possible? There's no point! It's meaningless once we have flagged
a number as "not prime". Additionally, we want to avoid checking if numbers are divisible
by 1, since every number is. 

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Removed number_to_test / 1** </summary>
1. number_to_test = 2:
    - ~~2 / 1 = 2~~
    - 2 / 2 = 1
    - **2 is prime!** 
2. number_to_test = 3:
    - ~~3 / 1 = 3~~
    - 3 / 2 = 1.5 -> NOT EVENLY DIVISIBLE BY DIVISOR
    - 3 / 3 = 1
    - **3 IS PRIME**
3. number_to_test = 4:
    - ~~4 / 1 = 4~~
    - 4 / 2 = 2 -> **EVENLY DIVISIBLE BY DIVISOR... So... NOT PRIME!**
    - No need to even check if 4 / 3 or 4 / 4
</details>

Also, have you thought about what type of variable can be used to decide if a number is 
prime or not? I hope so! It has to do with <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. I'm
so confident that you know the answer that I won't tell you! 

From an operator perspective,
we must implement the <code>%</code> to check if a number is perfectly divisible by another.
If a number is perfectly divisible by another, the result will be <code>0</code> since <code>%
</code> provides the remainder for a given division operation. 

Lastly, I'll ask you again... What type of control structure do we need inside our <code>
for loop</code>?

Another <code>for loop</code>!

:::tip[Challenging Yourself]
You can see that I am pushing you to learn here. It may seem tough, but it's so important
that you are able to retrieve or find information on your own. Keep up the good work. You
will figure this out. I promise, I have been in your position before and I know things can
feel nearly impossible at times. Keep working and you will get there.

### Implementing our Plan

We have decided we need the following: a <code>for loop</code> inside a <code>for loop</code>
and some sort of <code>boolean</code> to decide if we have a prime number or not. 

The structure of your code should look something like this:

```python
for number_to_test in range(2, 101):
    prime variable = false
    for loop to check all numbers up to number_to_test
        if statement to check if prime
            prime variable = true
    if prime variable is true
        print prime
```

## Completed Prime Code

```python
for number_to_test in range(2, 101):
    is_prime = True # consider number prime until we determine that it isn't
    for divisor in range(2, int(number_to_test ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number_to_test % divisor == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    if is_prime == True:
        print(f"{number_to_test} is Prime")

```
