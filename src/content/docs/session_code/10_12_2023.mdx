By this point in the course, you should be familiar with Flowcharts. If not, you should certainly review
that material on MyCanvas. Watch some of the videos that were provided and practice tracing a couple of 
them. 

## Modulus & Integer Division

During this session, we focused on tracing a Flowchart that was covered in class. Although, we spent a bit
more time on the mathematical operations that appeared while we were tracing. The two operators that we
spent extra time with were the modulus (%) and integer division (//) operators. 

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Modulus (%)">
        The modulus operator is used to calculate the remainder for a given equation. 
        Consider the following:

        ```
        5 % 2 = 1 
        ```

        This equation is asking for the remainder after dividing 5 by 2. 
        Since 2 can go into 5 twice (2 x 2 = 4), then we have 1 as the remainder. 

        Here are a few other examples:

        ```
        10 % 3 = 1
        4 % 2 = 0
        15 % 4 = 3
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Integer Division (//)">
        The integer division operator is used to calculate the number of times a 
        value can fit into another. 
        Consider the following:

        ```
        5 // 2 = 2
        ```

        This equation is asking for the how many times 2 can fit into 5.
        Since 2 can go into 5 twice (2 x 2 = 4), then we say our answer is 2. 

        Here are a few other examples:

        ```
        10 // 3 = 3
        4 // 2 = 2
        15 // 4 = 3
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Even or Odd?]
The modulus (%) operator is useful for determining if a number is even or odd. If a number 
is perfectly divisible by 2, then it is even, otherwise, it is not.

Consider the following:

```
4 % 2 = 0
5 % 2 = 1
6 % 2 = 0
7 % 2 = 1
```

## The Flowchart

<div align="center">
    <Image src={flowchart2} alt="picture of a flow chart" title="flowchart"/>
</div>

This flowchart should be familiar! This was taken up in class a couple of weeks ago.

We always begin tracing at the start circle of the flowchart. We then evaluate all of the
processing, input/output, and decision making components from there. There are several ways to trace a
flowchart. In class, we are typically taught to use a table, where each column represents a variable
in the flowchart.

For example:
| variable_1    | variable_2 | variable_3 |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- |
| value 1     | value 1   | value 1 |
| value 2     | value 2 | value 2 |
| value 3     | value 3   | value 3 |

Alternatively, you can write each step out, one by one (not taught, but it's a good way to keep yourselves organized).

For example:
1. variable_1 = value 1
2. variable_2 = value 1
3. variable_3 = value 1
4. [ ... ]
And so on, until the flowchart is complete.

**You can find the answer for tracing the flowchart below.**

| 9     | EEE    |
| 11    | EEEE    |
| 13    | EEEEE    |
| 15    | EEEEEE    |
| 17    | EEEEEEF    |
| 18    |     |

Good luck with this trace! Remember to use your course notes as a guide 
for tracing a flowchart.
