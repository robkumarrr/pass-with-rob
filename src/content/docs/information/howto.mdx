##### Hi Everyone! I'll be hosting PASS Sessions on:
<ul>
    <li>Mondays from 4 PM to 5 PM in I-219</li>
    <li>Fridays from 10 AM to 11 AM in F-170</li>
</ul>

These sessions give us the opportunity to have collaborative study sessions. We can work together on 
problems that you're facing in COMP 10001. Perhaps there's a <code>for loop</code> that you're stuck on,
or maybe a <code>flow chart</code> is getting complicated. Whatever it may be, I'm here to help!

##### So, **how do you use this website?**

It's quite simple! On the left-hand side of the page, you should see a sidebar that contains content from
all of the past PASS Sessions for this term. You will also see a section for **Information** (that's where you
are right now), and **Study Tools**. If you're viewing this on mobile you may need to click on the menu icon in 
the top right-hand corner of your screen.

When you're in a specific section on this website, you will also notice that each section has their own sub-navigation
found on the right-hand side of the page. Each of those menus starts with the **Overview** and then it follows all
of the headings found in the document. 

I will ***try my best*** to update this site as soon after a PASS Session as possible, but I am also quite busy so 
there may be a few days where it takes me a little longer. I want to make sure that everything I upload is high
quality and something that can be used for your success this term.
