### OOP & Model-View Basics

In object-oriented programming there are some concepts that will continue to come up.
Over time you will notice that these concepts are true even in other areas of programming. 
Separating the "model" from a "view" is critical in achieving a solid understanding of 
object oriented programming. 

Let's walk through an example. Say you're watching TV, and you decide that you want to 
turn on an NFL game and relax a bit. You'll interact with the TV (probably with a remote)
to search for that channel and select the channel to want to watch. While you're watching
the game, you aren't seeing how the game is being broadcast, you can't see how the TV's
software is working, and you don't have control over the outcome of the NFL game. In this 
example, we can think of the the TV as our "view" and the NFL game with the two teams as
our "model". Now, this is a massively over-simplified version of what really happens, but
I hope this gets you thinking about the separation of model and view. 

A few other examples include:
- Playing the Nintendo Switch in handheld mode - View: Nintendo Switch - Model: Game Logic
- Playing a computer game - View: Computer Screen - Model: Game Logic
- Interacting with a website - View: User Interface - Model: Backend (Logic, Server, Database, API, etc.)

I hope this is starting to clear up. OOP doesn't sink in overnight, so keep working at it! 

### Class "Stuff"

What's a class? Think of it as a *blueprint*.
What's an object? Think of it as building something *using* the blueprint you have. 
So, in other words, an object is an instance of some class. 

For example, you may have a blueprint for a house, but that blueprint is on paper and can't 
actually be used to live in. But, you can use that blueprint to create a house! Or even 
*multiple* houses! Each house would have a different attributes: address, perhaps a different colour, 
and even different styles for their windows. Each house is unique from one another, and they all 
have a specific location in a neighbourhood. To locate each house, there's an address, and that
address is specifically for one house. This is synonymous to how object references are stored in
the heap memory.

Think of other examples of "blueprints" and "houses", or in more appropriate words: classes
and objects. I can think of some extra ones here: businesses, dogs, humans, video games, etc.
You'll notice that each of these things are generic, but you can have a specific type of each
thing. So for a dog you may have a dachshund, or perhaps a doberman, or a duck tolling retriever,
but they're all dogs, right? I hope this is starting to come together. But that's the general
concept you need to understand to succeed in Java. 

I have an example below from our PASS Session, I hope it helps with understanding how this comes 
together. Again, if you're struggling, please read the weekly guides! They are very solid for
learning the overall concepts you need. 

### NFLTeam & Television

Below, you'll see that I have included the code for two classes. You can click on the details
to reveal the code. Have a look and try to decipher everything that's going on. If you're having
some trouble, try to review your class notes from the Week 3 and 4 guides. 

#### MODEL: NFL Team Class
<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **NFL Team Class Code**</summary>
```java
import java.util.Random;

public class NFLTeam {
    private String name;
    private String coach;
    private String captain;
    private int score;
    private int wins;
    private int losses;
    private static int ID = 0;

    public NFLTeam(String nameVar, String coachVar, String captainVar) {
        name = nameVar;
        coach = coachVar;
        captain = captainVar;
        ID++;
    }

    public void setScore(int scoreVar) {
        score = scoreVar;
    }

    public int getScore() {
        return score;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }

    public boolean playGame(NFLTeam opponent) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        boolean wonGame = false;
        int score1 = 0;
        int score2 = 0;

        while (score1 == score2) {
            score1 = rand.nextInt(0, 50);
            score2 = rand.nextInt(0, 50);
        }

        setScore(score1);
        opponent.setScore(score2);

        if (score > opponent.getScore()) {
            wonGame = true; // win game
        } else {
            wonGame = false; // lose game
        }

        return wonGame;
    }
}
```
</details>

#### VIEW: Television Class (where our Main method is)
<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Television Class Code**</summary>
```java
public class Television {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("TV has been turned on");

        NFLTeam ravens = new NFLTeam("ravens", "harbaugh", "jackson");
        NFLTeam vikings = new NFLTeam("vikings", "o'connell", "cousins");

        if (ravens.playGame(vikings) == true) {
            System.out.printf("%s won the game - %s: %d | %s: %d\n", ravens.getName(), ravens.getName(), ravens.getScore(), vikings.getName(), vikings.getScore());
            System.out.println("Ravens fans, rejoice!!!");
        } else if (ravens.playGame(vikings) == false) {
            System.out.printf("%s won the game - %s: %d | %s: %d\n", vikings.getName(), ravens.getName(), ravens.getScore(), vikings.getName(), vikings.getScore());
            System.out.println("Let's go Vikings!!!!!");
        }

        System.out.println("TV has been turned off");
    }
}
```
</details>

:::caution[What's going on here?]
Here's a challenge. Write out a handful of jot points to describe what's going on within each class, and how these classes relate to one another.
1. What objects have we created?
2. How do they interact?
3. What methods can you see?
4. What does private and public mean? 
5. **CHALLENGE -** Create your OWN model and view classes, create a method for the model, and call that method in your view.
6. **BONUS -** How can I rewrite my constructor in NFLTeam to keep it the same, but simplify it? Hint: *this* might be useful ;)
