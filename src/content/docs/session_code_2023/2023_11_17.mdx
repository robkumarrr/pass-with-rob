## Lists

Lists are AWESOME! This is one of the most important data structures you can deal with in 
programming. They are commonplace in both your client-side course and your java course, coming 
up next term. 

How can we describe a list? Well, the simplest way is to think about a bucket or a box that
contains a variety of items. These items can be the same, or different, and they might even
come packaged with other items. 

Programmatically, we can initiate an empty list like so:

```python
my_list = []
```

Not so bad, right? Let's add some items to this list. 

```python
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]
```

Notice that each item in the list is separated by a comma. For this example, we'll stick to 
using strings as the datatype, but you can also mix the datatypes within the list. 

For example this is completely valid:

```python
my_other_list = [1, 2, "apple", 4.5, "car", 5, "computer"]
```

Pretty neat, huh? I think so! This adds flexibility to our programming, which can be useful in 
a variety of contexts. Can you think of a reason why we might want to store two different data 
types in a list? Perhaps you want to store a movie and its rating, or a restaurant and its rating,
or a product, its inventory and price, or a name, address, phone number, age and other pieces of information.

## Accessing Data in our List

A list is useless if we can't access the data within it! Remember, python is a 0-indexed language, meaning
that we start our counts at 0, and move up until n iterations is reached. Check out the code snippet
below to see how we can access the items in <code>my_list</code> below.

```python
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]

# Access first item: 
my_list[0] 

# Access second item:
my_list[1]

# Access third item:
my_list[2]

# Access fourth item:
my_list[3]
```

If you want to display them, simpy use a <code>print()</code> function for each of those lines. 

**Example:**
```python
# Print first item: 
print(my_list[0]) 
```

I think you may agree with me... manually typing out each item in the list is not efficient. Can you think of
a way we could *go through our list*? 

Did you guess a loop? I hope so! Because that's exactly what we need. 

Let's try it out: 

```python
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]

# Note: "item" can be named something else if you want
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Alternatively, you can loop through a list like so:

```python
for i in range(0, len(my_list)):
    print(my_list[i])
```
