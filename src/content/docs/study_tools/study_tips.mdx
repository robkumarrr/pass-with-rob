### The Basics 

Typically, studying all stems from the same few rules. You need to focus on the specific content that
you are struggling with, which can be difficult, and then you need to repeatedly work on that material,
including the material you are *already good at*.
You may be wondering why you would want to even address things you are already good 
at, but it's important to not let yourself forget even the easiest material while you are learning harder
concepts. Think of learning as a pyramid, if we can imagine that the bottom of the pyramid is our foundational
knowledge, then we can continue to build upon those foundations.

### Active Recall

After spending years in academia, I must say that I have found the most success in a studying technique
known as *Active Recall*. I have have read and re-read course material, academic papers, documentation
and more, to only learn minor details from those sources. The main issue was that I spent time just
consuming material, and I never actually tested myself on the material. 

In essence, this studing technique requires learners to retrieve information
that they have already learned. The idea of *Active Recall* is that you are actively engaging with 
the material and you are forcing yourself to remember specific details. This is important because 
it provides you with feedback immediately! When you're just reading and re-reading material, you are 
not challenging yourself (perhaps just to stay awake through some dry material haha). 

You can read more about active recall [here](https://www.osmosis.org/blog/2022/02/21/active-recall-the-most-effective-highyield-learning-technique).

:::caution[Studying for Programming]
It may seem obvious for how we can apply Active Recall for content like math, english, history, science 
and other subjects alike, but programing feels a bit different. Programming requires a ton of repetition 
and so the *testing* may come in a different form. Read down below for how you can implement active recall
for programming courses.

### Implementing Active Recall
#### Flashcards

If you're studying for a test that requires memorization, I recommend the use of flash cards.
Flash cards are basically a set of cards where each card has a question or prompt on one side, and 
then the correct answer on the back. The idea is to go through your flash cards repetiively and 
learn all of the correct answers over time. If you're unable to answer the card's question, move on
but first have a quick look at the answer and try to make a connection between the card's answer
and problem.

My favourite way to implement flashcards is through software called Anki. 
You can find out more [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). There's a lot of documentation on the website
and it might seem a bit intimidating to use but it's well worth learning. I've used this for 
several tests at college and I've scored over 95% on both so far. 

Anki will present your custom-made decks to you in a manner that will space the questions out to 
give your mind the opportunity to consolidate new information. I highly recommend checking it out!

#### Put Your Notes Away!

This might seem self-explanatory... but I can assure you, many students study by re-reading content
without any means of applying it. If you can put your notes away you will benefit significantly from 
recalling the information you just learned. For example, when it comes down to programming, it's extremely
tempting to work on a project with all of the documentation right in front of you. It's probably true that a 
workplace setting will not discriminate between someone who needs to look something up and someone who has
the entire documentation page memorized for python. The point here is simply to become more efficient with
new concepts. The more you implement a concept, the more you'll be comfortable with it. This will occur
in all areas of your life, but programming specifically requires multiple repetitions to make improvements. 

If you're struggling to figure things out, it's okay to look things up, but try to commit those new concepts
to memory as you program. Perhaps it's your first time implementing a for loop or a list, but you can't remember
how to start either. Well, that's okay! Perhaps pseudocode some steps while you think. If it doesn't come to
you, then check out some python documentation. The next time you encounter these concepts, try to completely 
pull those ideas from memory. You'll be amazed at how much you can memorize just by following this pattern.
