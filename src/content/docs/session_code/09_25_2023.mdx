## Coding Bat - Diff21

During this session, we worked through a problem from [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com/python). 
The problem was the "diff21" from the warm-up section. This is a great place to 
start coding.

This problem asks us to create a function that returns the difference between any input <code>n</code>
and the number <code>21</code>. This code must return *double* the value if <code>n > 21</code>.

```python
    def diff21(n):
        # code goes here
        return #
```
