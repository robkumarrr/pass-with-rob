## Coding Bat - diff21
### What's the problem?

During this session, we worked through a problem from [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com/python). 
The problem was the "diff21" from the warm-up section. This is a great place to 
start coding.

This problem asks us to create a function that returns the difference between any input <code>n</code>
and the number <code>21</code>. This code must return *double* the value if <code>n > 21</code>.

```python
def diff21(n):
    # code goes here
    return #
```
### How do we get started?

It's quite simple! Let's start by answering the question *without* code! If we can understand the problem on paper, 
then we are more likely to be able to code this out properly on our first attempt. 

Let's begin with some pseudocode. 

Before you check out what I wrote down below, try to come up with a solution on your own. 


<details>
<summary>✅ **My Pseudocode - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```python
    # IF a NUMBER is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 21 
    #   then RETURN 21 minus the NUMBER
    # ELSE IF a NUMBER is GREATER THAN 21 
    #   then RETURN 21 minus the NUMBER multiplied by 2
```
</details>


Was your solution the same? Maybe different? How different? Do we reach the same answer at the end? It's 
possible that we reached the same conclusion with different paths. That is **okay**! Coding is an
adventure and it *might* not be perfect on the first try. 

### Time to Code

So, now that we have a solution let's try to code this out. 

We will need to use an "if" statement in this problem to provide a couple of different conditional routes.
In Python, we first type the word "if" then it is followed by a statement and lastly, a colon. If your 
program requires extra conditions, you can follow-up the "if" with "elif" and/or "else" on the next lines.

Here's an example:

```python
if a > b:
    # code block goes here -- don't forget to indent! 
    # IDLE should do this for you automatically
elif b > a:
    # code block goes here
else:
    # code block goes here
```

Now that we are becoming more familiar with Python code blocks, let's try to solve our problem. The solution
code is below. Give it a try on [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com/python) and see if you can solve this 
problem on your own before checking out my code.

:::tip[Hint]
You *might* want to use the built-in function called <code>abs</code>. 
<code>abs()</code> accepts one argument and will return an absolute value of the number you provide.
* Example: <code>abs(-5)</code> returns <code>5</code>

<summary>✅ **My Solution - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```python
def diff21(n):
    diff = 0
    if n <= 21:
        diff = abs(n - 21)
    else:
        diff = abs(n - 21) * 2
    return diff
```
</details>

Once you solve this question, think about how you can optimize it. My solution is certainly not the fastest way to 
complete the problem. 

After some trial and error, I eventually got my code down to one line!

<summary>✅ **My Solution V2**</summary>
It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.
```python
def diff21(n):
    return abs(n - 21) if n <= 21 else abs(n - 21) * 2
```
