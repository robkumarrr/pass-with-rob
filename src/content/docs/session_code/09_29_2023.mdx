### IPO Basics

**Input, Processing, and Output - or IPO for short.** This is the foundation of programming, and you'll be using these 
concepts all the time in your upcoming semesters. 


<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Input">
        What information or data are you given?
        
        Provide a description of these variables and consider specifics such as the data type, their range, etc. 
        Essentially, make sure you state the assumptions about the data.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Processing">
        What must you do with the information/data? This is where you create the algorithm.

        Create a detailed step-by-step process with clear instructions for how the data is handled by the system. 
        Explain all steps from the start (inputting data) to the end (outputting data).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Output">
        Where are your deliverables? 

        This could be a variety of things, perhaps it's a single value, or perhaps it's a string, but regardless,
        there is an output.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### IPO for a Flowchart

<div align="center">
    <Image src={flowchart} alt="picture of a flow chart" title="flowchart"/>
</div>

The flowchart seen on this page is what we went through during the PASS session. From this flowchart, 
what are the inputs and outputs? 

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Reveal Input/Output Solution - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```
INPUTS:
The variable named "n" is from user input.
An argument could be made that "sum" and "count" are considered inputs.

OUTPUTS:
The variable named "sum"
```
</details>

How would you write out the *pseudocode* for the processing for your IPO chart?

:::tip[Pseudocode]
Describing our algorithm using a cross between code and plain english. 

For example, if we have some code such as:

```python
def add_nums(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

We can pseudocode something like:

```
ADD num1 and num2
RETURN sum of num1 and num2
```
:::

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Reveal Processing Solution - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```
PROCESSING:
1) SET sum to 0
2) SET count to 0
3) ASK USER for a number and SET n = user input
4) ADD n to sum
5) ADD 1 to count
6) REPEAT from STEP 3 to STEP 5 until COUNT >=
7) DISPLAY sum total to the user
```
</details>

Try putting the IPO together into a table on your own. 

### Tracing the Flowchart

During this session, we also traced all of the variables in the flowchart. *Tracing* means that
we are going to track all of the changes and actions that occur in a flow chart. 

I'll start you off, and then you carry on with the remainder of the trace: 

```
1) start
2) sum = 0, count = 0
3) USER INPUT - n = 13 (You can pick ANY number you want - students in the session picked 13)
4) ...
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ **Reveal the Full Trace - Try it on your own first!**</summary>
```
4) sum = sum + 13 ---> sum = 0 + 13
   count = count + 1 ---> count = 0 + 1 
5) count < 5 = TRUE 
6) USER INPUT - n = 10 (You can pick ANY number you want here, like Step 3)
7) REPEAT STEPS UNTIL YOU HAVE EXITED THE LOOP
...
x) print sum
```
</details>
